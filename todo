inner insertion sort loop
merge sort (ie stable sort)
binary search (array and generic list)
fixed array size stack
fixed array size queue
test event loop api - with setinterval/clearinterval

(doubly-linked) linked list which supports stack and queue simultaneoulsy = double-ended queue
skip list (ie dictionary based on sorted doubly-linked list)
*assume single threaded and optional use of event loop
cache with ttl (ie like dictionary, but add throws exception if it exists already, so tryAdd/tryGet/tryRemove, has async methods, takes ttl, eviction notice handler, postponetimeout, 
set one of 4 eviction policies: LFU, MRU, LRU, FIFO, only 1 way to indicate eviction: max count)
